    <p class='text-center about-text'>This Movie Search Tool is for anyone who likes to look at or collect cool movie posters. I love experimenting with cool API's and this app uses OMDB's API to get posters. Users can then favorite a poster that they like and add it to their virtual collection. 
        Users can also get my personal opinion of their movie collection. I handle this by generating a random opinion from a local JSON file. Hope you have fun!</p>
